            My name is Aryan Tandon and I'm 21 years old. I was born and raised in Kathmandu, Nepal. In 2019, I came to the United States
            to get better education so I can return back to my country and help it develop through technology. I want to be a part of my generation which will
            transform our nation into a developed country. I didn't have this aim until a few months ago, but I also want to be a teacher (mentor) 
            to Nepalese youths when I return back to Nepal so the new generations can be the force of change. A long way to go but I'm ready and really hopeful of this journey.

            I have a few hobbies. Right now, I would say sports is my biggest hobby. I don't play sports quite frequently and I'm not good at sports but
            I really love watching them. I regularly watch Soccer, Cricket, Basketball, MMA, and Boxing. Out of all these, I enjoy watching UFC and Manchester United.
            Actually, I don't enjoy watching Manchester United play I'm more nervous when they play because they are so vulnerable as a team right now. However,
            the emotion is still there in the game and Win,Lose or Draw, I'm gonna be United fan. During the lockdown of the initial pandemic (Original Corona), I got
            hooked into watching UFC and now I'm a fan of the whole Mixed Martial Sport.

            Some fun facts about me are that I'm really tall in Nepal. I'm 6'3, that's tall here but there are a lot of guys of similar height or greater
            but back in Nepal the average height of Nepali men is 5'6. So, you could guess I was considered really big in Nepal. It used to be difficult to 
            find clothes & shoes so my mon would just take me straight to the tailor to make my clothes. I also couldn't fit in most public transports cause
            the height of the vehicles are so small. I used to get unwanted attention from random walkers back in Nepal, but also love from many of my villagers
            just because I was tall. Safe to say, being a big person in Nepal is not fun at all.
